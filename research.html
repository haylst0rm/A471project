<p>TTruth in Photography: A Historical Analysis</p>
<p>Conceived in the early 1800’s, Photography has changed drastically in its functional performance, its efficiency in production, and most importantly in the discipline’s intention to capture. In other words, the intention behind Photography has transitioned over time.  Photographers from the early 1800’s attempted to capture reality as objectively as possible, while current photographers focus on curating a certain depiction, resulting in a curated response from the viewer. The initial purpose of photography emphasized “truth” within photographs, so as to historically and visually document events throughout time. This emphasis on accurate, truthful depictions has transformed into an art form, where photographs are constantly manipulated or altered (even with intentions to be truthful). The Australian International Festival for Photography 2026 supplements this observation by stating, “The photograph has historically been viewed as an authentic, factual representation of truth. In more recent years, this long-held belief has been questioned through the prominent coverage surrounding manipulated and faked photographs, an element of the post-truth era”(PHOTO 2026).  Currently, this manipulation can be seen in a vast variety of styles: timing, lighting, cropping, Photoshop, Artificial Intelligence, and much more.  However, through researching the history of photography, there is evidence of these alterations tracing back as early as the first productions of the Daguerreotype. With this finding, and a consideration for current events in the photography community, a new channel of research has been found and the question was asked: How did photography transition throughout history, specifically regarding its authenticity and truthfulness in depiction?  The focus of this research delves into how producing photographs is difficult when trying to display an unbiased, accurate image. With this information in mind, the following historical analysis will chronologically and visually present the findings of this transition away from “truth”, as well as outline the conclusions made from research. 
</p>
<p>In order to possess a well-rounded coherence for analyzing the transition in truthfulness, one must first comprehend where photography originated from.  Beginning in 1839, inventor Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre constructed the daguerreotype development process.  In creating the daguerreotype, Daguerre captured a photo he titled Boulevard du Temple. This daguerreotype depicts an empty street, with the exception being a shoe shiner and their customer(Library of Congress). Without any historical context, one would consider this street almost completely devoid of people, giving the implication that this was taken during a less busy time of day. However, it is important to bring light to the process of daguerreotypes; the development of the photo takes about seven minutes, basically producing a long-exposure image. This long exposure only captured what remained still: the shoe shiner, the customer, and the buildings of the street. The missing visual context is a busy street, with many people strolling on the sidewalk. This occurrence is commonly seen in later times as a strategy for photographing architecture.  This image provides an example of alteration due to functional process; due to the time daguerreotypes take to develop, there are omissions of what was actually occurring on the street. The two observations of, one with context and one without, create very different understandings of this photo and could potentially mis-inform those who study it.  Boulevard du Temple is the earliest example of how images, no matter how truthful they seem, have most likely been altered or changed whether intentionally or unintentionally. 
</p>
<p>Following the daguerreotype was the calotype, a hazy-like image that revolutionized photography. William Henry Fox Talbot invented the calotype, patented in 1841, the development process being refined to using one negative photo for many prints and reproductions(MoMA 2025). Although this strategy for development clearly shows room for alteration, due to its inherently distorted visual result, there was still more subtle ways to edit. One popular technique was to “retouch” images post production: a more physical form of Photoshop.The images shown can be truthful in the sense that what has been captured can be placed within a time period of history, but the exact details of both photos are lost. For example, the viewer would not have knowledge of any events occurring, who the seated figure is, or even anything potentially cropped away.  This furthers the notion that truthfulness in photography is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a new historical development, the albumen print; created by Frederick Scott Archer in 1851, this process was highly detailed and able to produce multiple prints (PHOTO 2026). However, even within a process that produces detailed images of reality, manipulation of photographs persisted. A notoriously significant pair of photos to contribute toward the previous claim, titled The Valley of the Shadow of Death, was one of the first photographs of war.  Taken by Roger Fenton in 1855, these images depict a striking scene: a ditch littered with cannonballs, one photo possessing cannonballs on the road (Radiolab Podcast 2012). With basic observation one can see the immediate alteration of the images. Susan Sontag is quoted in her stance on war photography, “As noted by Susan Sontag (1933-2004), ‘Not surprisingly many of the canonical images of early war photography turn out to have been staged, or to have had their subjects tampered with’” (PHOTO 2026).  Sontag is directly emphasizing that war images are known to be altered in a way to add severity to the war occurring (in this case the Crimean War). This element of having context in viewing photographs vs. lacking context, which was also shown in the calotypes previously mentioned, follows a theory by Roland Barthes closely. Barthes’ theory revolves around the terms Stadium vs. Punctum. Simply put, Stadium refers to viewing an image with full context both visually and historically. Punctum refers to the initial, internal feelings brought up when viewing the picture (Barthes 1980). By recognizing both the Stadium and Punctum aspects that may emerge when perceiving an image, one can observe how “we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other possible sight” (Berger 1972).</p>
  <p>Daguerreotypes, Calotypes, and Albumen prints all serve their own purposes in the development of photo-making and Photography as a whole. However, one consistency remains throughout these three major developments of photos: all were inherently untruthful. Through a multitude of reasons and/or strategies, evidence of alteration and distortion were present. As the 1800’s conclude, and the 20th  century arises, there will be more evidence to further the lack of truth in photography. 
	The 20th century brought a fast-paced development in the technology of Photography. Notably, the 35 mm camera was invented by Oskar Barnack in 1913. This camera opened up manipulation in photos to an easily accessible technique. One example of manipulation during this time are the famous Cottingley Fairies of 1917. Although by the standards of current day this may not apply, these series of photos was crucial in the analysis of Photography and truth. A daughter and a cousin wanted to capture images of fairies they had been playing with, and came back with said photos:The reality that these photos were faked was not found out until the 1970s (MOH 2015).  This multiple decade-long mystery is consistent with the findings throughout this research, that even photos that appear real are also at risk of being altered.</p>
  <p>As the 1900s developed in both its photographical advances and as a society, the latter being in a drastically negative way. The Great Depression, lasting from 1929-1939 was an extreme downturn in economical growth; people were unemployed, starved, and dying. As this nationwide tragedy was occurring, the FSA (Farm Security Administration) sent photographers out in the 1930s to capture the severity this economical impact had on society. Another purpose behind FSA photographers was an act of persuasion; to resolve economic crisis the Roosevelt Administration implemented the New Deal Programs, with intentions to relieve, reform, and stabilize the economy. With this in mind, some photographers tried to capture images of positivity and hope, even if mostly unsuccessful (Brent McKee 2025).  Susan Sontag enforces this notion by stating: “The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the late 1930’s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Sahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film—the precise expression on the subject’s face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry (Sontag 6). The two images seen below are taken by Dorthea Lange, with her Graflex SLR (invented in 1898). As one can observe, one photo depicts a cheerful mother and child sharing a laugh. The adjacent photo depicts a very different atmosphere, with mother and child looking disheveled and dirty, unhappy or concerned looks on their faces. The photo that was published and popularized was the cheery one, resulting in associations to hope that the economy was healing. However, these two photos present how timing, taking multiple photos until the desired result is acquired, will culminate to a curated reaction. The truth in these photographs are lost, since one cannot simply ask the mother what she truly felt. This example shows that even the government utilizes manipulation and alteration to produce a desired picture, regardless of its truthfulness. </p>
  <p>Throughout the 20th century, the development in photographic technology drastically advanced, and with those advancements came more opportunities to distort and alter images. Moving forward towards the end of the 1900s, a novelist and art critic named John Berger produced a series of episodes (and essays) through BBC, titled Ways of Seeing. Produced in 1972, this series introduces the visual argument that images (both artwork and photographs) are inherently susceptible to manipulation, and at minimum can be interpreted by the viewer in countless ways regardless of the original creator’s message. Berger utilizes photographs, paintings, audios, and much more to explain to the viewer how even if the photograph is not altered, the individualistic bias in which people view the world affects how images are received. He states, “Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing” (John Berger 1972). Depending on the day one is having, what was seen/heard/felt before viewing, the atmosphere of society, and so forth all contribute to altering the way one interprets a photo.  An example he provides shows how what is presented to the viewer directly before or directly after viewing an image, can influence the overall comprehension of the piece. Berger presented The Executions by Fransisco Goya, and then presented two channels occurring the same time as his program. Depending on which channel was flipped off of, or on to, the atmosphere around Goya’s painting drastically changes (Berger 1972). John Berger’s essays are significant in the debate regarding truth and photography due to its ability to create a well-rounded understanding of how much photographs can be influenced. The research presented thus far all delve into the creator’s manipulation, while Berger accurately exposes the viewer’s manipulation in comprehension. The combination of creator and viewer both manipulating image in their own strategies, truthfulness can be almost completely eliminated in observing photographs.</p>
  <p>A final, and vital development in the discipline of photography was the creation of Adobe Photoshop. Originating in the 1990s, this platform was produced with the sole purpose of editing, changing, or altering photos. This advancement resulted in a immense upswing of manipulation: removing truthfulness in the sake of creating a direct message was initiated. Society began normalizing altered photos, but did not normalize the recognition that these images were not authentic. One can observe, in addition to this normalization, a shift from documentation to artistic expression in photography. One example of this newfound alteration is through an American photographer named Philip-Lorca diCorcia. He photographed the homeless community in Los Angelos, CA, and utilized photo alterations to further clarify his message: to bring recognition towards assisting homelessness and addiction in LA (Museo Del Prado 2006).The image taken shows a homeless man standing shirtless outside a window, food just within reach but separated by a window. Although this image is highly impactful, and the message is received relatively accurately, it is commonly known that diCorcia was talented at staging photographs.  By staging the photograph, the truthfulness of the image is lost, even if the message is still upholding. The atmosphere transitions from documenting a real, truthful situation, into an artistic expression representing diCorcia’s theme. The Metropolitan Museum of Art aligns with this deduction: “The staged situation[Anderson] interacts with the raw reality of the exchange of money, blurring the boundaries between documentary and fiction, yet preserving an authentic emotional charge” (MET 2025).  Overall, the introduction of Photoshop heavily contributed to the shift away from truth and toward artistic expression.</p>
  <p>The culmination of research from the beginning of photography until the 1990s has shown the lack of truth photographs can produce. This timeline of evidence now leads to the current century, the 21st century. The 21st century has brought a entirely new theme for photographs: fine art. Most photographs in current times are edited heavily, and it is very rare to find an unadulterated image. This made research more broad, since every photo was being manipulated, every photo could be an example used. In the information collected, there have been multiple uses for the overdone manipulation: politics, news, art, beautification, and so on. One photograph stands out in its manipulation tactics. In 2019, the World Wildlife Fund posted a 10 Year Challenge post to Facebook and other platforms, showing how deforestation has destroyed a large segment of a forest through a split image showing two photographs supposedly taken ten years apart. However, this image can be debunked simply by looking at the photographer’s original photo. One can observe the original photograph is singular, and rather an optical illusion that appears to split the photo in half. This being known, it is logical to conclude the WWF had cropped and manipulated this singular photo to appear as two, in order to fit the message the organization was trying to produce. This current example of manipulation, not in the sake of artistic expression, presents the persistence of altering truth in photography.</p>
  <p>Considering the entirety of photographic history, a constant has remained throughout all time periods: truth is always being manipulated or changed. There are three conclusions found within the research findings. Firstly, there are some elements of photography that can be inherently truthful (i.e. historical context clues to place a photo within a time period), but overall, photographs are almost always manipulated whether intentionally or unintentionally. This conclusion is easy to observe given the examples presented: Boulevard du Temple, a few calotypes, In the Valley of Shadow of Death, Cottingley Fairies, Mother and baby of family on the road, The Executions, Eddie Anderson; 21 Years Old; Houston, Texas; $20, Ways of Seeing, and the WWF post. All photographs presented show significant forms of manipulation, leading to the debate of its truthfulness. Overall, almost every photo is altered whether it be in staging, development process, or post-production edits. 
	The second conclusion found was that there is a significant shift/transition from trying to capture reality objectively, to the use of photography as a form of distortion in a variety of ways (positively or negatively).  This shift was seen emerging in the early1900s, but most notably rose in popularity with the invention of Adobe Photoshop. The transition from focusing on truth into emphasizing expression is important to recognize, so that one can observe photographs with context that the image is most likely altered and must be viewed ‘with a grain of salt’. 
	The last conclusion found is more open-ended: it is a acknowledgement that the debate of truth in photography will continue to be debated, especially given current society. The heavy influence of propaganda, widespread misinformation, and recently Artificial Intelligence, all contribute to a drastic shift rejecting truthful and authentic depiction. In order to stay rooted in reality, one must follow this debate and stay vigilant when observing photographs (this is not in reference to fine art). 
	In conclusion, the research presented within this historical analysis has shown truth and photography have a strained partnership: the struggle to capture real-life situations, but also curating a clear message of that situation through alteration. The purpose of this research was to call attention to untruthful photographs so that one may go and view future images in an educated manner.  Through the examples and historical context provided, one can conclude there should always be an analysis of the accuracy of what photographs are displaying.</p>
